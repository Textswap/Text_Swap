## Overview: 
Manoa TextSwap is a student-driven platform designed to simplify the process of buying and selling secondhand textbooks for the UH Manoa community. The platform enables users to upload used books for sale. Our admin review system ensures that only approved listings appear on the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù page. Users can easily search and filter listings to find textbooks for their specific classes, making the process of acquiring course materials more efficient and affordable. Built with modern web development tools like Next.js and hosted on Vercel, Manoa TextSwap combines a user-friendly interface with tools to streamline textbook exchanges and promote sustainability through reuse.

#### NavBar
On typical laptop and full screens, the navigation bar is displayed horizontally and includes options such as Buy, Sell, Cart, and Account, with an additional Admin link for admin accounts positioned before the Buy option. On smaller screens, the navbar transitions into a compact hamburger-style menu, represented by an icon that expands to show the same navigation options in a dropdown format for ease of use.

Selecting "Change Password" prompts you to confirm your current password before allowing you to set a new one, ensuring security. Choosing "Sign Out" logs you out of your account and redirects you to the landing page of the website. This setup ensures quick and secure access to account management functions.

#### Filters
<p align="center"> <img src="images/txsBuy.png" width=700px> </p>

#### List of Subjects
The Buy page includes a comprehensive filter system to help users find the right textbook. It features a price range slider for setting budget preferences, a dropdown menu to select from various subjects, and an optional input field for typing a course name, keywords, or ISBN. Additionally, users can specify their preferred condition for the textbook, ensuring a tailored and efficient search experience.

#### View Details
The Available Textbooks section dynamically displays textbooks based on the filters applied, including information about the owner of each textbook. Each textbook entry includes a "View Details" button, which provides more in-depth information about the selected book. Additionally, there are two action buttons: "Buy Now," which redirects the user to the payment page for immediate purchase, and "Add to Cart," which saves the selected textbook to the user's cart page for future review or purchase. This setup streamlines the browsing and purchasing process for users.

For our admin account, the View Details page includes an additional feature: a "Remove Book" button. This functionality allows the admin to delete a textbook listing if necessary. This feature is designed to ensure the accuracy and quality of the listings by enabling the team to manage and maintain the database effectively.

### Cart Page
The Cart Page displays a list of textbooks saved by users via the "Add to Cart" button. Each textbook entry includes a "Buy Now" button that directs the user to the payment form for immediate purchase and a delete icon for removing the textbook from the cart if it is no longer needed. Additionally, the author of each listed textbook is shown, making it easy for users to manage their selections while having all relevant details readily available.
If a user is the owner of a textbook, the "Add to Cart" button is disabled to prevent them from adding their own books to the cart.

### Payment Page 

The payment page serves as a placeholder to simulate a secure payment process, accessible through the ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù button. While users can type in information such as card details, names, and billing addresses, no actual payment or transaction occurs. This feature is designed to demonstrate how a payment system would function within the platform, providing a realistic user experience without processing real transactions.

### Admin Page 

The admin page serves as a central hub for monitoring and managing books uploaded by users, ensuring a safe and reliable environment for all participants. Admins can either approve or remove listings. Approved books are immediately displayed on the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù page, making them accessible for users to browse and purchase. Removed listings are permanently deleted from the system, maintaining the platform‚Äôs quality and relevance. Clicking on a book title redirects to a detailed view, allowing admins to review critical information before making decisions. This active monitoring by admins ensures that all interactions on the platform are secure and trustworthy.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1
Our first milestone was to get the basic skeleton up and running, with functionality of the landing page and the ability to swap between tabs, but not to have any actually working pages yet. In this goal it was specifically to have a mock-up of the page in order to slowly add functionality over the course of the next two milestones. View our project page [here]().

### Milestone 2
Our second milestone was to start adding minor functionality to the whole site, but not worrying too much about everything working smoothly. This milestone is more of a progress check in to ensure that we can complete the website on time in alignment with our current schedule. In addition, we intended to no longer need mock-ups for this milestone. View our project page [here]().

### Milestone 3
Our third and final milestone was to have the project completely finished and polished. In addition, in this milestone we started to collect community feedback from students in our college who are not part of our class. The feedback from the individuals we got reviews from are listed in the "Community Feedback" section. View our project page [here]().

## Community Feedback: 

#### Sam Tiwanak: 
Manoa Textswap is an intuitive site that simplifies a common issue for UH students. Often books just go unused after a course. With this website, I was able to easily navigate and even upload potential books I would want to sell. I think it‚Äôs a great idea and the layout works well.
